// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: The Controller service provides the API for orchestrating a collection of
 * debugger agents to perform debugging tasks. These agents are each attached to a process of an
 * application which may include one or more replicas.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The debugger agents register with the Controller to identify the application being debugged,
 * the Debuggee. All agents that register with the same data, represent the same Debuggee, and are
 * assigned the same `debuggee_id`.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The debugger agents call the Controller to retrieve the list of active Breakpoints. Agents
 * with the same `debuggee_id` get the same breakpoints list. An agent that can fulfill the
 * breakpoint request updates the Controller with the breakpoint result. The controller selects the
 * first result received and discards the rest of the results. Agents that poll again for active
 * breakpoints will no longer have the completed breakpoint in the list and should remove that
 * breakpoint from their attached process.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The Controller service does not provide a way to retrieve the results of a completed
 * breakpoint. This functionality is available using the Debugger service.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (Controller2Client controller2Client = Controller2Client.create()) {
 *   Debuggee debuggee = Debuggee.newBuilder().build();
 *   RegisterDebuggeeResponse response = controller2Client.registerDebuggee(debuggee);
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note: close() needs to be called on the Controller2Client object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;flattened&quot; method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;request object&quot; method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;callable&quot; method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of Controller2Settings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To customize credentials:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * Controller2Settings controller2Settings =
 *     Controller2Settings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * Controller2Client controller2Client = Controller2Client.create(controller2Settings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * Controller2Settings controller2Settings =
 *     Controller2Settings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * Controller2Client controller2Client = Controller2Client.create(controller2Settings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * Controller2Settings controller2Settings = Controller2Settings.newHttpJsonBuilder().build();
 * Controller2Client controller2Client = Controller2Client.create(controller2Settings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.

   * Updates the breakpoint state or mutable fields. The entire Breakpoint message must be sent back
   * to the controller service.
   *
   * &lt;p&gt;Updates to active breakpoint fields are only allowed if the new value does not change the
   * breakpoint specification. Updates to the `location`, `condition` and `expressions` fields
   * should not alter the breakpoint semantics. These may only make changes such as canonicalizing a
   * value or snapping the location to the correct line of code.
   *
   * &lt;p&gt;Sample code:
   *
   * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
   * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
   * // It will require modifications to work:
   * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
   * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
   * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
   * try (Controller2Client controller2Client = Controller2Client.create()) {
   *   UpdateActiveBreakpointRequest request =
   *       UpdateActiveBreakpointRequest.newBuilder()
   *           .setDebuggeeId(&quot;debuggeeId-1833285553&quot;)
   *           .setBreakpoint(Breakpoint.newBuilder().build())
   *           .build();
   *   ApiFuture&lt;UpdateActiveBreakpointResponse&gt; future =
   *       controller2Client.updateActiveBreakpointCallable().futureCall(request);
   *   // Do something.
   *   UpdateActiveBreakpointResponse response = future.get();
   * }
   * }&lt;/pre&gt;
