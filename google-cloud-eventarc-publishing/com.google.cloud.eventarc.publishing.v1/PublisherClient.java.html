// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: Eventarc processes events generated by an event provider and delivers them
 * to a subscriber.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or product that can generate and
 * deliver events through Eventarc.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside of Google.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated with Eventarc.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A subscriber is a GCP customer interested in receiving events.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed by the subscriber in
 * their GCP project. A Channel represents a subscriber's intent to receive events from an event
 * provider. A Channel is associated with exactly one event provider.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed by the
 * partner in their GCP project. A ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and a
 * subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one mapping with a Channel.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to Eventarc.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (PublisherClient publisherClient = PublisherClient.create()) {
 *   PublishChannelConnectionEventsRequest request =
 *       PublishChannelConnectionEventsRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setChannelConnection(&quot;channelConnection-1932021695&quot;)
 *           .addAllEvents(new ArrayList&lt;Any&gt;())
 *           .build();
 *   PublishChannelConnectionEventsResponse response =
 *       publisherClient.publishChannelConnectionEvents(request);
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note: close() needs to be called on the PublisherClient object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;flattened&quot; method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;request object&quot; method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;callable&quot; method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of PublisherSettings to create().
 * For example:
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To customize credentials:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * PublisherSettings publisherSettings =
 *     PublisherSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * PublisherClient publisherClient = PublisherClient.create(publisherSettings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * PublisherSettings publisherSettings =
 *     PublisherSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * PublisherClient publisherClient = PublisherClient.create(publisherSettings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * PublisherSettings publisherSettings =
 *     PublisherSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setTransportChannelProvider(
 *             PublisherSettings.defaultHttpJsonTransportProviderBuilder().build())
 *         .build();
 * PublisherClient publisherClient = PublisherClient.create(publisherSettings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
