/**
 * Service Description: [Service Control API
 * v2](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Private Preview. This feature is only available for approved services.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This API provides admission control and telemetry reporting for services that are integrated
 * with [Service Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure).
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (ServiceControllerClient serviceControllerClient = ServiceControllerClient.create()) {
 *   CheckRequest request =
 *       CheckRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setServiceName(&quot;serviceName-1928572192&quot;)
 *           .setServiceConfigId(&quot;serviceConfigId650537426&quot;)
 *           .setAttributes(AttributeContext.newBuilder().build())
 *           .addAllResources(new ArrayList&lt;ResourceInfo&gt;())
 *           .setFlags(&quot;flags97513095&quot;)
 *           .build();
 *   CheckResponse response = serviceControllerClient.check(request);
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note: close() needs to be called on the ServiceControllerClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;flattened&quot; method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;request object&quot; method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;callable&quot; method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of ServiceControllerSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To customize credentials:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * ServiceControllerSettings serviceControllerSettings =
 *     ServiceControllerSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * ServiceControllerClient serviceControllerClient =
 *     ServiceControllerClient.create(serviceControllerSettings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * ServiceControllerSettings serviceControllerSettings =
 *     ServiceControllerSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * ServiceControllerClient serviceControllerClient =
 *     ServiceControllerClient.create(serviceControllerSettings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To use REST (HTTP1.1/JSON) transport (instead of gRPC) for sending and receiving requests over
 * the wire:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * ServiceControllerSettings serviceControllerSettings =
 *     ServiceControllerSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setTransportChannelProvider(
 *             ServiceControllerSettings.defaultHttpJsonTransportProviderBuilder().build())
 *         .build();
 * ServiceControllerClient serviceControllerClient =
 *     ServiceControllerClient.create(serviceControllerSettings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
